A basic Svelte and Tailwind setup.

Run `npx degit vinliao/svelte-tailwind your-app-name` to pull repo. Run `cd your-app-name`. Run `yarn` to install (or, use the `npm` equivalent). Run `yarn dev` to serve file; run `yarn run watch` to make Tailwind's CSS available to use. Both have to run when developing.
